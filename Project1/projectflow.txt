1.a
Generate data w FF on x,y in [0,1]
OLS on data, w/wo noise N(0,1). Use polynomials up to 5th order,p.
Q.Find confidence interval of beta from variances VAR(beta)=1/N sum(Beta_i - bar(beta))? . 
Q.Evaluate (OLS using different p) by MSE and R2 for different N and noise. 
1.b
Split data in test/train.
Implement k-split cross val algo
1.c
Include bias-var trade off. Explain terms of eq., which is bias which is variance and discuss their interpretations.
Discuss the bias and variance tradeoff as function of your model complexity
(the degree of the polynomial) and the number of data points, and possibly also
your training and test data. Try to make a figure similar to Fig. 2.11 of Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman,
see the references below
1.d
Write your own code for the Ridge method
