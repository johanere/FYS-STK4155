# FYS-STK4155 - Project 1
### Important note on terminology:
I've learned that I have been using the term "predictor" inaccurately, also in this project. Detail on this may found on the first page of the project report, before the authors' comments. Please keep this misconception in mind when reading the project

### Folders
All tex files used to compile the project report may be found under "Tex". All programs ued in obtaining the results described in that report is under "Code", while the results themselves may be found under "Results". The data used in the last part of the project may be found under "DataFiles".
