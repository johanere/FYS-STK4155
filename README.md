# FYS-STK4155

On terminology:
I've learned that I have been using the term "predictor" inaccurately, also in this project. A reader will most likely find that this project implies that a model such as $\beta_0 + \beta_1 x +\beta_2 y+ \beta_3 x^2+\beta_4 y^2+\beta_5 xy$ has two predictors (x and y), while it in reality has six: $1,x,y,x^2,y^2,xy$. Please keep this misconception in mind when reading the project
